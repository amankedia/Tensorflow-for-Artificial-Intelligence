# Tensorflow-for-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains code for solving basic to advanced problems using Tensorflow.

It introduces multiple code snnipets for building AI systems and how Tensorflow can be leveraged for the same.

The most interesting concepts dealt in this repository is the concept of Interpretable AI or how we can visualize what's happening in between the layers. This gives a perception of how features are being extracted from the images by the various layers.

The datasets used are MNIST and horse or human. Their links have been provided in the notebooks.
